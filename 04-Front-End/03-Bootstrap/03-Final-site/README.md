## Background & Objectives

It's time to give your website the final touch to reach this [objective](http://lewagon.github.io/karr-examples-frontend-02/).

Here are some guidelines:

- Over-ride the bootstrap navbar with the code snippet we gave you.
- Over-ride the buttons' colors. Choose nice colors using kuler or colorzilla.
- Change your fonts using Google fonts (reminder: Open-Sans is a good choice for texts)
- Choose your own features' icons on nounproject. Maybe you will have to resize them using sketch or another tool, to give them the same height, the same width, and harmonious respective proportions.
