## Background & Objectives 

The objectives of this challenge are :

* Embrace the [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/) library, it will be your best friend for the rest of your life!
* This challenge focus on the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), you will not need to use other components of Bootstrap here. But the grid system is the hardest part of Boostrap, all the rest is just a matter of copy & paste!
* Embed [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons, which behave as texts as you will realize (this is VERY convenient).

In the HTML of the canvas, we already put the good tags. **All you need to do is add the adequate bootstrap classes to some of these tags**. You should not add any additional tags that the ones we gave you!

## Specs

Change the **HTML**, and the HTML ONLY, to reproduce [this design](http://lewagon.github.io/showroom/Layouts/header-better/blog.html) :

## Optional

* If you have completed this challenge, try to change you HTML markup (this time by adding HTML tags), to have 3 blocks, one for the post title and date on the left, 1 central for the post content, and a last block on the right with social links (FB/twitter).

* Give some custom responsive behavior to your website and test it by changing your window's size.
