## Background & Objectives
A very simple exercise to learn how to loop in ruby using different iterative structures, or using a recursive algorithm.

## Specs
- Write a method in ruby that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value (min and max included). Ex: what is the sum of the integers between 1 and 100 ?
- You should at least implement the two simple versions, using `for..end` and `while..end` structures
- **enhancement (optional)**: Try to implement the recursive version => http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)

## Tips & Resources
- [ruby loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm)
- In ruby, using an `each` iterator is considered more idiomatic than a `for` loop when you want to iterate through a collection.

## Learning Badges
- What are the different options to loop in a ruby program ?
- What's the difference between using a `while..end` and `for..end` structures ?
