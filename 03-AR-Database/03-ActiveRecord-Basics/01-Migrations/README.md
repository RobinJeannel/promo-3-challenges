## Background & Objectives

- Understand what is an [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), such as `ActiveRecord`.
- Understand the concept of migration and the distinction between a model and a migration.
- Learn how to execute `migrations` on your database running `rake` tasks.

#### Migrations
Imagine you want to add a new column in your table, but you do not want to remove the table and create a new one (because you don't want to delete your data), so you need a migration for that! Migrations are classes that can perform actions on your database scheme. As you know, a relational database has a scheme (the architecture of your database) and it is very important to keep control of this scheme.

VERY IMPORTANT: 

- The model **REPRESENTS** your data in ruby => it models your data, that's why it's called a model. 
- The migration just PERFORM OPERATIONS ON the database scheme. 

These are two separate roles, hence separate classes.

#### Rake
Rake [http://rake.rubyforge.org/](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) is a ruby program that helps you run tasks from the command line. These tasks are defined in a Rakefile. Notice that you have been using `rake` tasks from the beginning to run your tests. 

Here we have a new Rakefile in `/lib`, in which we defines tasks on the DB. **Examples of database rake tasks**

* `db:create`: Task that creates the database
* `db:delete` : Task that deletes the database
* `db:migrate` : Task that runs the database migrations

As you will see, Rails will automatically create similar rake tasks for you. 

## Specs 

In `/db/migrate` we created a `20131226095300_create_posts.rb` file, containing an Active Record migration class. Migration files are always in the following format `yyyymmddhhmmss_migration_task_name.rb`. It enables rake to keep track of the current state of the migrations already executed.

1. Write code in `20131226095300_create_posts.rb` to create the `posts` table. You have to read the documentation of Active Record Migrations [here](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html). Your `posts` table should have the following columns:

	* name:string 
	* source_url:string
	* date:datetime

2. Run this migration running `rake db:migrate`

3. Create a new migration to add a new column `rating:integer` to the posts table. You need a new file for that (with good naming conventions) . Then run this new migration with `rake db:migrate`.

4. Finally, pimp the existing interface to print nicely the results from database queries and enable other tasks.
